      The Pomodoro Technique is a tool for time management and productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work for one &#39;pomodoro&#39; (one set interval â€” usually 25 minutes)
      and then have a short break. After 4 of these, go and have a long break.
      It&#39;s simple and effective for flow, focus and productivity.
